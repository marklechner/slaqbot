  - Title: Can I use Nmap for network scanning?
    Question: \
      I want to do some basic network scanning to understand our infrastructure better. Is it okay if I use Nmap or similar network scanners?
    Answer: \
      While you need an IT ticket and exception to have binaries such as nmap installed on your company device, network scanners can be used in a safe,
      non-disruptive manner with proper authorization. Scanning should be done using techniques like ping sweeps and version detection, not brute force methods.
      For example, a scan using "nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24" to ping each host would be acceptable. But brute force scanning of ports or services is prohibited without permission. 
      Please contact the infosec team to discuss appropriate use cases if you need to actively scan internal networks.

  - Title: Is Burp Suite allowed?
    Question: \
      I'd like to do some web app testing as part of my job. Can I use Burp Suite or other web proxies to intercept traffic?
    Answer: \
      Burp Suite and other intercepting proxies are not permitted without prior authorization. While these tools are useful for web app testing,
      they can also be used maliciously. Please submit a request to IT and infosec if you require the use of Burp Suite or similar tools.
  
  - Title: Can I use vulnerability exploitation tools?
    Question: \
      Are we allowed to use exploit frameworks like Metasploit or tools that exploit vulnerabilities without explicit permission?
    Answer: \
      No. The use of exploitation tools like Metasploit, sqlmap, and others is strictly prohibited without proper authorization.
      Ethically exploiting live systems can be illegal and destructive. Please submit requests for approval before using any tools that exploit vulnerabilities.
